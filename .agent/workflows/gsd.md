# GSD - Get Shit Done

GSD mode is for rapid, iterative implementation of a specific feature or fix.

1.  **Understand the Goal**
    - Read the user request and any linked files.
    - If ambiguous, make a reasonable assumption and proceed (bias for action).

2.  **Plan (Quickly)**
    - Create a mini-plan in your scratchpad.
    - Break down into: Backend, Frontend, Integration.

3.  **Execute (Iterative)**
    - **// turbo-all**
    - Write code.
    - Run tests/builds immediately after writing.
    - Fix errors immediately. Do not ask for help unless blocked by missing credentials/info.

4.  **Verify**
    - Run the relevant verification script.
    - If it passes, you are done.

**Motto**: "Perfect is the enemy of done. Ship it."
